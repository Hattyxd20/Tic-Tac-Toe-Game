# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. My implementation of this game utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an engaging user interface and a smooth gaming experience.
